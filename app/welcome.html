		<h3>Pool is now xmr-node-proxy ready!</h3>
			<p>If you are managing more than 10 miners, check out <a href="https://github.com/Snipa22/xmr-node-proxy">xmr-node-proxy</a>, a proxy specifically designed for our pool software. It will allow you to manage and direct your workers in an efficient manner.<br>
			The proxy will provide several improvements over currently available solutions like atrides proxy or HAproxy deployments. Biggest improvement will be without a doubt the ability to split the requested work to individual miners. That means unlike other solutions, it will appear to the pool as a single miner requesting work at normal rate, but at the cumulative difficulty the miners connected to the backend are capable of. This not only potentially reduces the load on the pool servers dramatically, but also allows for more efficient mining. First tests have shown a dramatic increase of hashrate especially with low hashrate miners.
